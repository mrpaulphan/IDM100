## 03 - Site Planing

### 1/3 - Develop a plan for what you want your site to accomplish

Explain and answer to the following questions below.

- What does your website do? (ex. showâ€™s off my work, offers a product, provides a service)
- Who is your target audience? (ex. employers, customers, friends, dog lovers)
- How can you keep people coming back? (ex. feature a blog section, list new products, post new music or videos)

### 2/3 - Sitemap
A site map (or sitemap) is a list of pages of a web site accessible to crawlers or users. It can be either a document in any form used as a planning tool for Web design, or a Web page that lists the pages on a website, typically organized in hierarchical fashion. You will need to create a sitemap for you site and present it.
