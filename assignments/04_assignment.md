## 04 - Wordpress Themes

You will be giving a short (3 minutes or less) presentation focused on your theme selection for your site. Be prepared to explain and defend your theme selection based on your planning documentation. Please include a minimum of two themes in your presentations. If you are interested in a more premium theme, DO NOT buy it until we go over this assignment in class. I will let each student know if they are able to use the theme they have selected. You can find some Wordpress themes located on blackboard under the "Wordpress Themes" Tab. There I list a some sites you can look at.


- Why this theme is a good fit for your current idea?

- What you like/dislike like about the themes?

- Does this complement my website content?

- Is it easy to customize?  

- Will it be aesthetically pleasing to not only me but also my visitors?

- Is it compatible with different browsers?

- Is there a support option?

- Is it easy to setup?
