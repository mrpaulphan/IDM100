# 02 - Hosting + Site Inspiration

Register a domain and hosting plan with a provider of your choice. 
You can use **any** hosting provider you want but you must be able to install WordPress on that server (Check with the hosting company). I recommend you use Bluehost as the company you use to provide you with web hosting. I will be using Bluehost to demonstrate how to install WordPress throughout the year and will not be able to help you if you run into hosting issues outside of bluehost. 


## Sign up for hosting
[Sign up for Bluehost here](https://www.bluehost.com/track/mrpaulphan)

**DO NOT SIGN UP WITH YOUR DREXEL EMAIL!** 

We've ran into many issues in the past using your school email address. Outlook will block the URL and give you issues receiving your activation email from Bluehost. I recommend you use an alternative email address. 

### Recommended Package Information 

For this class, the basic plan should be perfectly fine with you. Feel free to choose whatever plan works best for you. 

- Account Plan (Whatever works best for you)
- Domain Privacy 
- Everything else is optional. Having those other packages donâ€™t hurt you. They just help. 

## Submitting Work
Submit a link (clickable) to your registered domain 

Example: [http://mywebsite.com](http://mywebsite.com)

After registering a domain with Bluehost or any other registrar, it typically takes between 24 and 72 hours for your domain to show up in the registry database and for the information on the new domain to propagate to all the root DNS servers.

If this is the main domain on your Bluehost account, you may check your website using the temporary URL as indicated in the "Welcome to Bluehost" email you received upon sign-up.

If this is not the main domain on your Bluehost account, you may use the temporary URL in combination with the directory which the new domain has been assigned to.



## Site Inspiration Presentation 
You will be giving a short (3 minutes or less) presentation in class focused on inspiration you can draw from on the web. Come to class with whatever presentation files and assets you need and be prepared to use the instructor's workstation computer to present your work to the class. You also have full access to the classroom whiteboard and can present your information in any way you prefer (e.g. printouts, drawings, PPT/Keynote etc.)

**You will be graded on:**

- overall presentation
- preparedness
- quality of assets/materials
- ability to defend your decisions and presented information
- ability  to follow directions


## Submitting Work

You will upload your primary asset file, preferably a MS PowerPoint file, to BBLearn prior to the assignment due date/time. If you need to upload more than one file, please zip the file and upload one file. Your file name should follow `idm100-hwk02s-[Drexel Username].[File Extension]` naming convention (`idm100-hwk02s-pp455.zip`). 

NOTE: Teaching station does have Keynote, however it is not the latest version of the program, and files created with newer versions of the software are not compatible and therefore will not open.
