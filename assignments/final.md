# Final 
**Description**: A multi page website programmed with HTML/CSS.

**Grading criteria:**
I will be checking each project using Google Chrome. I would recommend that you do all of you work in Google Chrome so we both see the same site. Your site must have real content. When I come to your site, it should not look unfinished. 



**Functionality**
Everything needs to work. All links, videos, audio, images, sideshows, rollovers etc. If it's part of your site, it should be working properly.



**Design**

Everything should look beautiful. Colors, patterns, and type should be working together to create a beautiful aesthetic. This also means that the styles in the theme you are using have been customized to meet your original design plans. Your site muse be responsive (work on all screen sizes)! Test your site on your mobile device. Enhancements are great. Changing something because you didn't get around to implementing it or couldn't figure it out are not valid excuses.



**Quality**

You need to present quality work. This project represents the summation of 10+ weeks of work, make sure it is ready for prime time!



**Other requirements**
- Your site must have content. If you do not have enough content, fill out your site with dummy content that is relevant to.



- You must have  a minimum of three pages
- Have a navigation 
- Must be responsive! Your site should be aesthetically pleasing to look at on your mobile device/table/ and computer
- Use post categories
