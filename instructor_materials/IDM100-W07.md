## Week 7

### Media

---

### Media consists of

- images
- video
- recordings
- files

^ Media consists of the images, video, recordings, and files that you upload and use in your blog. Media is typically uploaded and inserted into the content when writing a Post or writing a Page. Note that the Uploading Setting in the Settings Media Screen describes the location and structure of the upload directory (where your media files are stored). If you do need to upload Media, even if that Media is not related to a Post or Page, then you need to use the Media Add New Screen.

^ The Media Library Screen allows you to edit, view, and delete Media previously uploaded to your blog. Multiple Media objects can be selected for deletion. Search and filtering ability is also provided to allow you to find the desired Media.

^ Media Library provides two type of views. One is simple visual Grid View and another is conventional List View. Switch between these views using the icons to the left above the screen.

^ In Media Library List View, a table lists all of your Media, by row. The Media are listed with the newest uploaded Media first.

^ In Media Library Grid View, clicking an Image thumbnail, Audio icon or Video icon will display an Attachment Details dialog, which allows you to preview media and make quick edits. Any changes you make to the attachment details will be automatically saved. You can also delete individual items and access the extended edit screen from the details dialog. Use the arrow buttons at the top of the dialog, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard, to navigate between media items quickly.

^ Attachment Details changes its appearance and information by media type. The left side of this dialog shows the Image, Audio player or Video player. The right side lists the following media file attributes and optional data. Some of them are editable from this dialog.

^ To add a new media item to your library, click the Add New link. From here, upload a new image. Once your image has been uploaded, youâ€™ll see it has been added to the library.

^ If you have more than one file to upload at once, WP will automatically switch to the multi-file uploader, just drag and drop multiple files to be added to your WordPress Media Library.

^ Once of the neat features of the WordPress media library is the ability to edit images. Click on an image, then click the Edit Image button. Now, you can crop, rotate, flip or scale the image.

## Embeds

```
Check out this cool video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

That was a cool video.
```

^ To embed a video or another object into a post or page, place its URL into the content area. Make sure the URL is on its own line and not hyperlinked (clickable when viewing the post). WordPress will automatically turn the URL into a YouTube embed and provide a live preview in the visual editor.

^ Let's try it.

---

## Shortcodes

```
[embed width="123" height="456"]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ[/embed]
```

^ Another option is to wrap the URL in the [embed] Shortcode. If WordPress fails to embed the URL, the post will contain a hyperlink to the URL.

---

## Embed Availability

>> Does This Work With Any URL?

^ No, not by default. WordPress will only embed URLs matching an internal whitelist. This is for security purposes.

---

### You can use all of these:

- Flickr
- Hulu
- Instagram
- SoundCloud
- Spotify
- Twitter
- Vimeo
- Vine
- YouTube
