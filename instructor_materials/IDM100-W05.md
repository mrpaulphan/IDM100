^ To get started with your WordPress site, you will need to log in using the username and password you created when installing it. You can log in at http://www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin where you will see the following form:

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.008.jpg)

^ Once you have logged in, you be presented with the WordPress dashboard. This is the main admin area for WordPress where you can configure the settings for your site, create posts and pages, install themes and plugins and a whole lot more. On first installation of WordPress there is a helpful "Welcome to WordPress" section at the top which contains some links you can follow to start having a look around and getting used to the Dashboard.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.005.jpg)

^ You can now take a look at the front end of your website, where you will see the default blogging theme installed, named "Twenty Fifteen". In later parts of this tutorial, we will look at how you can customize your site by adding different themes.

---

### General Settings

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.010.jpg)

^ There are a few settings which need to be taken care of on each new installation of WordPress. This is also a good chance to get familiar with your Dashboard. To start off, in the sidebar, visit "Settings" > "General" and you will see that here you can set some options for the site:

^ Site Title (Name of your Site)

^ Site Tagline (Description of your site)

^ WordPress Address (Location of WordPress)

^ Site Address (Your site homepage if you installed WordPress in a directory)

^ Email Address (Admin email)

^ Membership (Tick this if you want people to be able to register on your site)

^ New user default role (Leave as subscriber for now)

^ Date Format

^ Time Format

^ Day the Week Starts

^ Site Language

---

### Writing Settings

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.011.jpg)

^ writing settings allows you to set the default post category. Right now there is only one. Once you have multiple categories you can set this to one, then delete uncategorized if you like. Post via email is not really needed these days. If you are looking to really promote your site you can click that Update Services link and copy and paste the list from the WP codex.

---

### Reading Settings

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.012.jpg)

^ In the reading section you can set wether you want your home page to be a static page, or an archive of your recent posts.

---

### Discussion Settings

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.013.jpg)

^ The next step with a new WordPress site is to configure your "Discussion" settings, which control the commenting feature. People can leave comments on your posts, which is a great feature but should be controlled so you prevent spammers from leaving comments. To do this, visit "Settings" > "Discussion". I recommend that you un-tick the "Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new articles" box, as this can be open to abuse. The other options are fine to leave for now, but can be modified later if you start to receive a lot of spam on your site.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.014.jpg)

^ At the bottom of this page, you have some options for "Avatars," which are the small icons left next to a person’s name when they leave a comment. You can choose which default ones to use if the user does not have one set, or you can disable them completely if you prefer.

---

### Media Settings

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.015.jpg)

^ Media settings you can pretty much leave standard unless you have a custom theme that needs specific images sizes. we will get into media in a moment.

---

### Permalinks

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.017.jpg)

^ Permalinks - the URL structure your website will use. For SEO the best structure is the "Post Name’ option

---

### Users

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.018.jpg)

^ You can also manage the users via the user tab in the side bar

---

### Profile

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.019.jpg)

^ Another section worth checking out is your Author profile page. This is located under "Users" > "Your Profile" and lets you set some options for using the site and personal information about yourself.

^ At the top of the page you can choose to disable the "Visual Editor". I recommend that you keep this enabled as it’s very handy when writing your posts. You can choose a different admin color scheme if the default one is a little too plain for you. You can also disable the "Toolbar" when browsing your site. The toolbar is a bar which runs along the top of your site with shortcuts to various site features. Personally, I disable this as I like to view my site the way visitors would, but it’s up to you to decide if you find this feature useful.

## Pages vs Posts

^ Out of the box in WordPress you are able to add two types of content: posts and pages. The method of adding content to them is nearly identical, as we will see in the next section, but they function differently on your site so it’s worth just explaining the difference between them.

---

### Pages

**Pages** are typically timeless, static piece of content.

- linked to from a menu (header/footer/sidebar)
- example: about, contact, terms & conditions, etc…

^ Pages are intended to be "one-off" static pages that are used on your site for things like an about me page, a contact page, terms and conditions, and so on. By default, comments are turned off on pages as they are not typically needed. Pages do not appear on the front page of your site when you add content to them; they are designed to be linked to from a menu, either in your header, footer or other place.

---

### Posts

**Posts** are timely pieces of content typically displayed in reverse chronological order.

- sorted by category, date, tag
- example: blog entries, news articles, etc…

^ Posts make up the content of your blog. When you publish a post, it is the latest item shown on your site and when a new post is added, this will push it down the page. Posts have comments open on them by default and can be sorted into categories, by date and also by tag (more on this next). Your posts display in reverse chronological order and will appear in your website’s RSS feed, while pages do not.

---

## Post Organization

- Categories (required)
- Tags (optional)

^ To help group your posts together, there are two features you can use: categories and tags. Categories are required. Tags are optional.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.026.jpg)

---


## Categories

- chapters in a book
- define main topic discussed in a post
- can be hierarchical

^ Categories are like the chapters in a book as listed in the Table of Contents. Categories define the main topic discussed in the post. categories can be hierarchical

---

## Tags

- index of a book
- detail multiple specific topics in a post
- not hierarchical

^ Tags work like the index of a book. Tags detail multiple specific topics defined in the post. tags are not hierarchical

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.029.jpg)

^ When you publish a post, you can choose a category to place it under which will house all posts related to that subject, allowing a user to select this category on your site and browse all your posts related to it.

^ You can add categories as you go from the Post Editing screen, but I prefer to set them up in advance. You should brainstorm which topics you will be commonly writing about and add them now.

^ To do this, visit "Posts" > "Categories" and you will see a box to add a new category. Add them one by one here until you are satisfied with the result.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.031.jpg)

^ We now move on to the Post Editing screen, which is where you will probably be spending most of your time within the WordPress Dashboard. The Post Editor is where you can create new posts, edit them, and publish them to your website, and you can also schedule them to be published at a certain date and time. Visit "Posts" > "Add New" to get started.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.033.jpg)

^ If you want to insert a link, highlight a piece of text and click the link icon and enter the URL for your link.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.034.jpg)

^ If you click the gear icon, you will get options for how the link should behave or to create a link to an existing page in your site.

^ When you are done you can then click the "Preview" button to see how the post looks on your site. It is not live yet, so don’t worry about that.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.035.jpg)

^ By default you have certain formatting options contained in the Visual Editor. If you click the far right icon called "Toolbar Toggle", it will add a second row underneath with even more formatting options you can use to create your post text.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.036.jpg)

^ If you must copy from MS Word, use the paste as text. do not paste (command - v ) directory from word, it will add tons of junk code

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.037.jpg)

^ if you know html you can write in code by clicking on the text tab. Note that `p` tags are not required as wp will auto create `p` tags for unformatted lines.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.038.jpg)

^ You can add or select tags or categories directly on the post page featured images are used in some but not all themes. If you upload an image, and select a featured image this will be the one associated with the post for thumbnail or archive views.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.039.jpg)

^ Some but not all themes have special post formats for specific media content

^ When you are finished creating your post you can click the PUBLISH button
there are also other options here.

---

## Media Library

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.041.jpg)

^ An important part of any blog post is the accompanying images. All images, videos and audio in WordPress are controlled by the "Media Library".

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.042.jpg)

^ When writing a post, you can access this to upload an image or pick one that has been used before. On your post editing screen, click the "Add Media" button just above the Visual Editor. This will load up a pop-up box and will show any images you already have used on the site.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.043.jpg)

^ Once your file(s) have finished uploading, you will be presented with some options on the right-hand side.

^ You can give each image a title and caption if required, Alt Text and a Description, and then you can choose some display options for when it is inserted into your post. You can choose an alignment (None, Left, Right, or Centered), Link to (None, Custom URL, Media Attachment Page, or the File itself), and you can can also choose a size (Full Size, Medium, or Thumbnail). Click the "Insert into Post" button and your image will now be added to the post.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.044.jpg)

^ If you find you need to change any of the settings, simply click the image once and a toolbar will appear where you can change them.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.046.jpg)

^ So now you have written your blog post, inserted your links and images, and it’s ready to go live. Before you publish your post, there are a few final things to do before you do so. On the right-hand side of the post editing screen are some boxes you should complete. Ignore the top one, "Publish", for now; we will visit that last. Choose a category for your post from the list you initially created. You can also add a new category here if you need to. Enter some tags for the post in the tags box, clicking "Add" after each one. And lastly is the "Featured Image" box; here you can upload an image associated with your post. Different themes display this differently, but will typically be the large image at the top of the post. It is uploaded the same way as before, using the Media Library uploader.

---

![fit center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/04-wordpress-intro.047.jpg)

^ Once you are satisfied with those options, go back to the top of the right menu, where you have the "Publish" box. To publish your post live immediately on the site, simply click the "Publish" button and it will go live. Before doing so, I just want to point out a great feature of WordPress, which is the ability to "Schedule" posts. Clicking the "Edit" button next to the "Publish immediately" text opens up calendar area where you can pick an exact date and time for your post to go live. If you do that and click "OK", the "Publish" button will change to a "Schedule" button, which when clicked will add your post to go live when you chose. This is a handy feature if you want to add a lot of posts at once and then spread them out over a period of time.
