^
- Different cultures have different associations with colors,
- These associations are North America.
- If you are designing for a different culture, make sure you know the color associations for the related culture. Example: in America what color do we associate with baby girls? Pink. In Japan? light blue. How about baby boys in America? light blue, and in japan? black.

## Warm & Cool Colors

![fit inline](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/color_wheel-temp.png)

^ Colors that are opposite each other on the The color circle can be divided into warm and cool colors.
- Warm colors are vivid and energetic, and tend to advance in space.
- Cool colors give an impression of calm, and create a soothing impression.
- White, black and gray are considered to be neutral.

---

## Complementary Colors

![fit inline](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/color_wheel-complimentary.png)

^ Colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel are considered to be complementary colors (example: red and green).
- The high contrast of complementary colors creates a vibrant look especially when used at full saturation.
- This color scheme must be managed well so it is not jarring. Complementary color schemes are tricky to use in large doses, but work well when you want something to stand out.
- Complementary colors are really bad for text.

## Analogous Colors

![fit inline](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/color_wheel-analogous.png)

^
- a * nal * o * gous
- Analogous color schemes use colors that are next to each other on the color wheel.
- They usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs.
- Analogous color schemes are often found in nature and are harmonious and pleasing to the eye.
- Make sure you have enough contrast when choosing an analogous color scheme.
- Choose one color to dominate, a second to support.
- The third color is used (along with black, white or gray) as an accent.

---

## Triadic Colors

![fit inline](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/color_wheel-traidic.png)

^
- A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel.
- Triadic color schemes tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues.
- To use a triadic harmony successfully, the colors should be carefully balanced - let one color dominate and use the two others for accent.

---

## Split-Complementary Colors

![fit inline](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/color_wheel-split_complementary.png)

^ The split-complementary color scheme is a variation of the complementary color scheme.
- In addition to the base color, it uses the two colors adjacent to its complement.
- This color scheme has the same strong visual contrast as the complementary color scheme, but has less tension.
- The split-complimentary color scheme is often a good choice for beginners, because it is difficult to mess up.

---

## Tetradic Colors

![fit inline](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/color_wheel-tetradic.png)

^
- The rectangle or tetradic color scheme uses four colors arranged into two complementary pairs. This rich color scheme offers plenty of possibilities for variation.
- Tetradic color schemes works best if you let one color be dominant.
- You should also pay attention to the balance between warm and cool colors in your design.

---

## Square Colors

![fit inline](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/color_wheel-square.png)

^ The square color scheme is similar to the rectangle, but with all four colors spaced evenly around the color circle. Square color schemes works best if you let one color be dominant. You should also pay attention to the balance between warm and cool colors in your design.

---

## Monochromatic Colors

![fit inline](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/monochromatic_colors.png)

^ The monochromatic color scheme uses a single hue mixed with a series of tints, tones, and shades. This palette can also be paired with  a range of grayscale colors.

## How many fonts should I use?

- Personalities can sometimes clash
- Wedding reception entertainment

^ Fonts, like people, have personalities. And fonts' personalities,  just like those of people, can sometimes clash.

^ Think of your fonts as table guests at a wedding reception; 
- one entertainer is usually enough as too many strong personalities can make the atmosphere awkward.

## Font Paring

When you're selecting multiple fonts to work together it is crucial that you maintain both unity and variety.

---

![center](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/font-paring-01.png)

^ Does this paring and size selection work?

^ There's not enough distinction between headline and text. Also, using display font for body copy. bad.

---

![center 30%](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/font-paring-02.png)

^ Does this paring and size selection work?

^ Using same font and weight for both can be a good decision, but way too much variation between sizes, is a bad choice.

---

![center 30%](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/font-paring-03.png)

^ Does this paring and size selection work?

^ This is a classic. Sans serif bold headline, serifed body copy. A 60pt headline, 18 pt body copy, using classic font scale.

---

![center 30%](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/font-paring-04.png)

^ Use serif for headline and sans for body due to resolution on screen, but now with high density monitors not really an issue.

## Screen Graphics

- Enhancing Information Architecture
- Building Atmosphere
- Bolstering Identity

^ Screen graphics, if used properly, can be a powerful communication and attention getting technique.
- They can hold the users attention, add interest to a screen, and quickly convey information.
- Improperly used graphics can confuse the user, lead to navigation inefficiencies, and be distracting. Screen graphics must always serve a useful purpose.

^ (_click_) Screen graphics can be used to guide the eye. And like lines, boxes and contrast, it can be used to separate content into logical divisions. Using it effectively in conjunction with other methods is vital. The goal is not to abandon other methods of information architecture, but to enhance their effectiveness.

^ (_click_) Our users want websites that do more than just display content in a user-friendly way. (_click_) They want websites where they can identify with the brand. Screen graphics can be used to achieve this in many ways.
