^  To get Google’s attention first, a blog should be optimized around specific content that appeals to the site’s ideal visitor demographic. Learn about Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and include keywords and content themes that might help in ranking higher in the Google Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs).

## Publishing Schedule

^  People are creatures of habit and if they know that a blog updates its content regularly, they will be more apt to check it more often. Publish content two or three times a week, preferably on the same days of the week at the same time.

---

## Network with Bloggers

^  Who is more likely to promote a blog post willingly than other bloggers in the same niche? It’s a “I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine” approach. Use social networks to friend or follow experts in the same niche and then comment on their blogs and build a relationship with them.  When a person comments on a post in another blog, it often asks the author to give the URL to a website. People who want to know more about the author of the comment will be led back to your blog.

---

## Promote Your Site

^  There are a variety of ways to get others to do some promotional work for you. One, is to simply ask the audience to share the content of the blog freely. Another, is to add social networking share buttons at the end of every post to make it easy for them to do a “one-click” share. Try something like https://wordpress.org/plugins/floating-social-bar/

---

## Use Multimedia

^  Blogs with pictures and embedded videos are more likely to be shared than those with just text. Instead of hosting your own audio, video, or photos, try using existing social sites like SoundCloud, YouTube, Vimeo, Flicker, or Google Photos then embedding the media into your site.

---

## Facebook / Linkedin Group

^  Not everyone will come to a blog from a search engine query. Other readers can be found on social networking sites like Facebook. To create a tribe, make sure to have a presence on Facebook and post status updates regularly. The links will take them back to the website.

## Email Marketing

^  Once someone visits your site, you want to convert that anonymous person into an email lead. Build up an email contact list with services like http://optinmonster.com, https://www.constantcontact.com/, or http://mailchimp.com

---

## Auto Publish

^  Know your audience and auto publish to the social media sites that they use; Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn

---

## Be Active

^  It isn’t just about pushing to social sites. Check out the demographics of different social networks and start engaging people on the platform that matches up with your ideal customer base.  That might be anything from Twitter to SnapChat to Pinterest. Meet with people where they already are and then create an expert presence that inspires them to go back and check out your offerings.

## Stay Up To Date

^  By default WordPress can automatically update itself when a security or minor release is available. For major releases, you have to initiate the update yourself. You also have to install plugin and theme updates manually as well.  Keeping your WordPress site updated is extremely important. Same goes for all plugins and themes installed on your website. You need to install updates for themes and plugins to get new features and fixes.
