> By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.

-- Benjamin Franklin

^ Talk about personal experience
^ Talk about how we plan Everything out at work
^ Talk about Gettysburg and how that failed
^ We will be going through and planning the site, design, wireframes etc.

## Ask Yourself

- What is my site about?
- Who will use this site?
- What will they use it for?
- Why will they use it, and continue to use it?
- What should it look like?
- How should it work?
- Where should it work?

^ As you think about your final project, ask yourself these questions.

---

### Examples
^ Building portfolio site vs building personal about yourself

## Content Inventory

^ Once you can answer these questions about your project, the next step is to focus on the content you will need to build your site. You need to take inventory of what you have, and what you'll need to get or create.

---

### Content inventory

- images
- photography
- videos
- animations
- audio/music
- programs
- **text, titles, subtitles, descriptions**

---

^ Once you know what data you need, ask yourself - where is it? What format is it in?

---

## Sitemap

### A graphical outline

---

![fit](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/sitemap.png)

^ A sitemap shows page structure and the general flow of a website. The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. It will also show how pages can be grouped.

## What's Next in the Planning Phase?

- Sketches
- Wireframes
- Visual Inventory
- Style Tiles and Mood Boards
- Comps

---

## Common Results of Failing to Plan

- The designer or developer is forced to make assumptions, which may or may not be correct, about how certain content will appear on the website.
- The amount of back-and-forth communication about trivial matters can be multiplied many times over.
- Backtracking causes delays and missed deadlines.
- Work that falls outside the original scope of the project creates cost overruns.
- Confusion and client dissatisfaction are byproducts of a shoot-from-the-hip process.
