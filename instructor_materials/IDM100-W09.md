## What are Plugins?

A WordPress Plugin is a program, or a set of one or more functions, written in the PHP scripting language, that adds a specific set of features or services to WordPress, which can be seamlessly integrated using access points and methods provided by the WordPress Plugin Application Program Interface (API).

^ There are plugins for thousands of different uses. Here are some examples of what you can achieve with plugins:

---

## Free Plugins

There are many, many free plugins that are available for WordPress. The best and arguably safest place to find these plugins is in the WordPress Plugin Repository.

## Installing & Activating Plug-Ins

^ We now move on to one of the most powerful elements of WordPress: plugins. Plugins are pieces of extra code you can upload and install on your WordPress website to provide extra functionality that is not included in WordPress by default. Plugins are an easy way for anyone to extend the capabilities of WordPress without having to touch a line of code. You simply upload the plugin via your Dashboard and activate it, and it will begin working.

^ Via the plugins menu you can activate, deactivate and delete your plugins. Some will even have a ‘settings’ link if there are customizable features. Hello Dolly and Askimet are typically pre-installed. I recommend deleting Hello Dolly,

^ If you are going to allow comments on your blog, you should activate Askimet. But I also recommend activating this after JetPack

^ Installing a plugin works in much the same way as installing a theme. Once again, the WordPress directory is your best option for free plugins. It currently hosts around 40,000 different plugins for just about every piece of functionality you could wish to add to your site. It has a good search engine, so you can search for keywords related to what you wish to achieve.

^ if you are NOT going to allow comments I recommend you use a comment remover this will strip all comment code out of your site and even hide the comment section from the dashboard.

^ If you click through on a plugin, each has their own listing page which will give you a description written by the plugin author. They will also include some screenshots, installation notes and sometimes an FAQ.

^ Down the right-hand side you can see requirements for the plugin, when it was last updated, and how many installs it has, and under that is a rating based on people who have tried the plugin and given it a 1-to-5-star rating. You should use these as a guide to how good the plugin is. Try and pick one which has been updated recently, has more installs and has a good star rating.

---

## Premium Plugins

^ Premium or commercial plugins work the same way as premium themes. They will be provided on a marketplace or the author’s own website and should include customer support. A lot of times when searching for a free plugin on the WordPress directory, you will see that the author offers a “pro” version of their plugin, which will often include more features or add-ons for a fee. I like these so called “freemium” plugins, as they gives you a chance to try the free version to see if it suits you, and then you can upgrade to a pro version if you need the support or extra features offered.

^ A large marketplace for premium plugins is called CodeCanyon. Created by the same company as ThemeForest, it currently offers 3,700+ WordPress plugins in many different categories. As mentioned before, make sure you check the listing description, check out the demo and read the reviews before purchasing.

^ Another way to install a plugin is to upload it directly in zip format via your Dashboard. To do this, visit “Plugins” > “Add New” > “Upload Plugin”. Click the “Browse” button and locate the theme’s zip file on your computer, and then click “Install Now”.

## Recommended Plugins

- Yoast SEO
- Akismet
- ContactForm7
- WP Super Cache
- WooCommerce
- JetPack
- WordFence
- WP No Base Permalink

^ Yoast SEO – This is quite simply the best SEO plugin for WordPress and will add a lot of features designed to help you rank better in the search engines. I install this on every single WordPress website I create.

^ Akismet – Akismet comes bundled with WordPress and is an anti-spam plugin designed to stop comment spammers from abusing your website.

^ ContactForm7 – The best free contact form plugin; really easy to setup and customize so you can create as many contact forms as you like with different input fields.

^ WP Super Cache – This is another must-use plugin. It will speed your WordPress site up considerably by utilizing “caching”, which means creating static HTML pages for your site which will load a lot faster for your visitors.

^ WooCommerce – If you plan to sell via your website, than WooCommerce is the best free eCommerce plugin. There are lots of available extensions and themes available for it.

^ JetPack – JetPack works like a toolkit for your WordPress site. You install the main plugin, and then there are lots of different modules you can enable for a whole range of site features.

^ WordFence – WordFence is a security plugin which provides a whole range of features designed to protect your site against hackers and malicious traffic

## Recommended Security Plugins

- Limit Login Attempts
- Captcha On Login
- WordFence
- Sucuri
- Rename wp-login.php

^ Limit Login Attempts – This plugin will only allow so many failed login attempts. If too many are tried, it will block the IP address to prevent further attempts. This is useful to block “brute force” attacks, where the hacker will use a script to try and gain access to your admin area.

^ Captcha On Login – This is another way to protect your admin. By forcing the user to enter a Captcha code on login, this will prevent bots and other automated methods of logging in.

^ WordFence – This is a full security plugin which can check to see if your site is infected, block malicious traffic, and improve login security and the ongoing monitoring of your site.

^ Sucuri – This is a premium service which costs from $199 per year. They provide ongoing security scanning and monitoring with alerts and, in the event that your site is hacked or defaced, they will completely fix the problem for you and restore your site.

---

## Recommended Backup Plugins

- Backup WordPress
- BackWPup Free
- WordPress Backup to Dropbox
- VaultPress

^ Another part of WordPress maintenance and security is making sure you have regular backups of your website. In the event that you are hacked or something goes wrong with your hosting, etc., if you have a complete backup of your site then you can restore it. How often you take backups will depend on your site. If you are blogging each day, you will need daily backups, but if you only add content every month, then a weekly backup should be fine for you.

^ Backup WordPress – This plugin is simple to set up and will let you set up a backup schedule. It works well with shared hosting companies, where you might not have much available memory.

^ BackWPup Free – This is another plugin for scheduling backups, but will also let you store those on Dropbox and a range of other cloud services.

^ WordPress Backup to Dropbox – This plugin is designed specifically to back up your site to your Dropbox account; easy to set up and authorize the plugin.

^ VaultPress – This is a service by the creators of WordPress. You can get Daily backups stored on their servers from $9 per month.
