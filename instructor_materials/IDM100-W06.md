### Wordpress Themes

---

A **WordPress Theme** is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. These files are called template files. A **Theme** modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software.

^ Kind of like a theme in PowerPoint, but better, because the system will automatically choose the page design and put the content into it dynamically as the page is being requested by the individual user.

^ These days there is a WordPress theme for just about any purpose. There are niche-specific themes for creating a website for a doctor, a hotel, a job board, a photography portfolio and so on. There are also a lot of more generalized themes aimed at bloggers, business owners and so on. Most themes can be broken down into one of the following categories:

^ Blogging – Designed to be used for blogging as the main purpose

^ Business – For creating complete corporate-style websites

^ Portfolio – For displaying images or videos

^ Magazine – Similar to blog themes but used for more complex layouts

^ eCommerce – Used to build online stores

^ Multi-Purpose – Larger themes which can be used for different purposes

^ App – A more complex theme designed for a singular purpose, e.g., a directory, job board or real estate site

^ Frameworks – A basis to create your own custom themes on top of


^ Different types of themes will offer different styling and functionality within them, so it’s worth carefully reading the theme description and checking out the demo for the theme to see if it will suit your needs. Next up, we are going to look at where you can get free themes and paid themes, the differences between each and how to install them on your website.

## Installing a WordPress Theme

^ With colors you can set a mood, attract attention, or make a statement. You can use color to energize, or to cool down. By selecting the right color scheme, you can create an ambiance of elegance, warmth or tranquility, or you can convey an image of playful youthfulness. Color can be your most powerful design element if you learn to use it effectively.

^ Responsive web design utilizes special CSS code, known as media queries, to determine the width of the browser window and modifies the layout accordingly.

^ Fluid Web design means that the content will flow  as the browser is resized to keep all content on the screen without horizontal scrolling.

^ Fixed layouts mean there is a pixel dimension set to the with of the layout and if the browser is sized thinner than the fixed width the user will have to horizontally scroll to see the info. I recommend checking both responsive and fluid.

^ You can also choose to search other websites for themes, some free, some pay for usage. Once you have downloaded your theme, it will be in zip format and you have two options to install it. A simple way to install a theme is to upload it directly in zip format via your Dashboard. To do this, visit “Appearance” > “Themes” > “Add New” > “Upload Theme”. Click the “Browse” button and locate the theme’s zip file on your computer, and then click “Install Now”.
