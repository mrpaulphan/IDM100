## Custom Menus

^ The Custom Menus option allows you to create customized menus for your WordPress site. Each theme will have different menu places defined in the theme, and from here you can choose what links you would like to add to each one to aid your visitors’ navigation. To access this feature, visit “Appearance” > “Menus” to get started (you can also access this via the Customizer if you wish to see a live preview).

^ Now you can begin adding links to your menu using the options on the left. You can add any pages from your site, any posts, and any categories, or you can create custom links which can link to any URL. You can also rename the links how you like and drag and drop the order of them until you have your menu looking how you want. In the “Menu Settings” area underneath you will see tick boxes with names. These are the available menu areas provided by your theme and will be different between different themes. Tick a location and click “Save Menu”, and it will now be live on your site.

## Widgets

^ Widgets are a way of adding different pieces of content to your theme in the sidebars, footer and any other “Widgetized” areas that your theme may provide; each theme is different, but most will include at least a sidebar area to house these.

^ They are accessed via “Appearance” > “Widgets”, where you will see a list of available widgets on the left-hand side and your areas on the right. To add a widget to your site, you simply drag and drop the required one over to the desired area.

^ Once the widget is in place on the right, you can click on it to open it, and you will see each widget has some different options you can set. For example, here the “Categories” widget will display a list of all the categories on your site. You can give it a name choose to display it as a drop-down list, choose to show the post count for each category, and choose to show the hierarchy (if you have categories within categories).
