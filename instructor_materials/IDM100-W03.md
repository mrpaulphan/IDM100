## What's the difference between

### UI & UX

^ Has anyone heard the these terms?

---

### User Interface Design<br>-<br>User Experience Design
![fit right](images/UX-UI.png)

^ User Interface Design is focused on the structure and organization of the content on the screen, as well as visually guiding the user through a product’s interface via interactive elements.

^ User experience design is the process of enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty by improving the usability, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the customer and the product.

## Sketching

### Developing rough ideas for design and layout

^ As you think about your final project, you will be sketching to bring out rough ideas for the design and layout of your site.

---

> I'm not an artist.<br>I can't draw.

^ If you're not a designer or artist, dont worry....

---

## Sketching is functional

![fit right](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM100/presentations/images/stickfigure.jpg)

- artistic quality is not the point
- sketching is functional
- generate ideas
- solve problems
- communicate effectively

^ You don't have to be an artist to sketch. When you feel in adequate in your sketching, pause and reconsider your perspective. Artistic quality of your sketches is not the point. The real goal of sketching his functional. It's about generating ideas, solving problems, and communicating ideas more effectively with others. Don't worry about how well you draw, think of your sketching as visual thinking, which works regardless of your drawing quality. Ugly gets the job done just fine.

^ Sketching user interfaces is just a combination of shapes. Everyone can draw shapes.

---

## Don't underestimate the power of sketching

- Amplify software/hardware tools
- create/explore/discuss

^ Adding sketching to the design process is a great way to amplify software and hardware tools.

^ Sketching provides a unique space that can help you think differently, generate a variety of ideas quickly, explore alternatives with less risk, and encourage constructive discussions with colleagues and clients.

---

## A variety of ideas quickly

- rapid idea generation
- deeper concepts
- withhold judgment

^ Sketching is great for rapid idea generation.

^ Push past that first bunch of surface ideas to get the deeper concepts out of your head.

^ The key to generating many ideas is to withhold judgment of them as good or bad until your sketching session is complete.

^ First capture the ideas, letting them flow without worrying if they’re any good. Wait until you’re finished to judge and filter.

---

## Explore Alternative

- Explore ideas
- Detect/reveal issues early
- Ask "What if?"

^ Sketching offers you the freedom to explore alternative ideas.

^ Early in a project it’s important to see a variety of different ideas so you can choose the best option. Sketching works well for this, as you can explore those varied ideas quickly.

^ Drawing out ideas works as an early detection system—revealing potential issues before significant time is invested.

^ This is the time to ask “what if?” and explore the answers that pop into your head.

^ Sketches have an amazing ability to foster discussions about ideas.

^ Sketches give everyone involved the permission to consider, talk about, and challenge the ideas they represent.

## Wireframes

### Functional Layout Plans

---

## Wireframes

- Arrange elements to accomplish a purpose
- Depict content, interface elements, navigational systems
- Lacks typographical style, color, graphics
- Focus on functionality, behavior, content priority

^ A lot of designers will take the elements that need to appear on each page and start by creating wireframes. This involves sketching or shading areas where each element of the page will go (such as the logo, primary navigation, headings and main bodies of text, user logins etc).

^ By creating a wireframe you can ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included.

^ You should not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website in the wireframe. It should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page.

## Paper Prototypes

---

### Built for budget

- paper is cheap
- technology free
- easy documentation

^ Paper is low cost compared to software.

^ Using paper also allows you to turn off your laptops, stop checking Facebook and focus on your work.

^ You can also easily keep notes on the back of paper - easy documentation.
